# Ethics & Dual-Use Statement

**Scope & Intended Use.** The QLS toolkit quantifies quantum-information signals in physical/biological simulations and datasets. It is intended for scientific research, educational exploration, and transparent benchmarking.

**Dual-Use Risks.**
- Misinterpretation of QLS as proof of “life” without corroborating evidence.
- Overfitting/QC drift leading to spurious claims in biological contexts.

**Mitigations.**
- Preregistered predictions for wet-lab work (Phase 6).
- Reproducible pipelines, deterministic seeds, and nightly drift checks (CI).
- Clear reporting of confidence intervals and acceptance thresholds.

**Data Governance.**
- Only non-identifying, non-clinical research data are supported.
- Contributors must comply with institutional biosafety and data-handling policies.
